# percy-maestro

[Percy](https://percy.io) visual testing for [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) mobile testing flows. Supports Android and iOS.

> **Runtime:** supported on BrowserStack Maestro sessions (Android + iOS).
> See [Runtime support](#runtime-support) for details.

## Prerequisites

- [Percy CLI](https://github.com/percy/cli) with maestro-screenshot relay support
- [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) 2.0+
- An Android or iOS app under test (iOS supported on BrowserStack real devices)

## Installation

Copy the `percy/` directory into your Maestro workspace:

```
your-maestro-workspace/
  percy/
    flows/
      percy-init.yaml
      percy-screenshot.yaml
    scripts/
      percy-healthcheck.js
      percy-screenshot.js
  your-flow.yaml
```

No package manager or build step is required. The SDK is a set of Maestro sub-flows and JS scripts that you include directly in your workspace.

## Usage

### Initialize Percy

Add a `runFlow` step at the beginning of your Maestro flow to initialize Percy. This performs a healthcheck against the Percy CLI server and sets `percyEnabled` for downstream steps.

```yaml
- runFlow: percy/flows/percy-init.yaml
```

### Take a screenshot

Add a `runFlow` step wherever you want to capture a screenshot. Pass the `SCREENSHOT_NAME` environment variable to name the snapshot.

```yaml
- runFlow:
    file: percy/flows/percy-screenshot.yaml
    env:
      SCREENSHOT_NAME: Homepage
```

### Full example

```yaml
appId: com.example.myapp
---
- runFlow: percy/flows/percy-init.yaml

- launchApp

- runFlow:
    file: percy/flows/percy-screenshot.yaml
    env:
      SCREENSHOT_NAME: Home Screen

- tapOn: "Settings"

- runFlow:
    file: percy/flows/percy-screenshot.yaml
    env:
      SCREENSHOT_NAME: Settings Screen
```

Run the flow with Percy:

```bash
npx percy app:exec -- maestro test your-flow.yaml
```

## Configuration

Device metadata and other options are passed as environment variables to your Maestro flow.

### Core Options

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SCREENSHOT_NAME` | Yes (per screenshot) | - | Name for the screenshot; must be unique per snapshot |
| `PERCY_SERVER` | No | `http://percy.cli:5338` | Percy CLI server address |
| `PERCY_DEVICE_NAME` | Yes | - | Device name for the Percy tag (e.g. `Pixel 7`) |
| `PERCY_OS_VERSION` | Yes | - | OS version (e.g. `13` for Android, `17` for iOS) |
| `PERCY_SCREEN_WIDTH` | Yes | - | Screen width in pixels |
| `PERCY_SCREEN_HEIGHT` | Yes | - | Screen height in pixels |
| `PERCY_ORIENTATION` | No | `portrait` | Screen orientation (`portrait` or `landscape`) |
| `PERCY_TEST_CASE` | No | - | Test case name for grouping snapshots |
| `PERCY_LABELS` | No | - | Comma-separated labels for the snapshot |

### Comparison Options

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PERCY_REGIONS` | No | - | JSON array of regions for ignore/consider (see [Regions](#regions)) |
| `PERCY_SYNC` | No | `false` | Set to `"true"` to wait for comparison result and log details |
| `PERCY_STATUS_BAR_HEIGHT` | No | `0` | Status bar height in pixels (excluded from comparison tile) |
| `PERCY_NAV_BAR_HEIGHT` | No | `0` | Navigation bar height in pixels (excluded from comparison tile) |
| `PERCY_FULLSCREEN` | No | `false` | Set to `"true"` if the screenshot is fullscreen (no system chrome) |
| `PERCY_TH_TEST_CASE_EXECUTION_ID` | No | - | Test harness execution ID for CI/CD correlation |

Pass environment variables when running Maestro:

```bash
npx percy app:exec -- maestro test \
  -e PERCY_DEVICE_NAME="Pixel 7" \
  -e PERCY_OS_VERSION="13" \
  -e PERCY_SCREEN_WIDTH="1080" \
  -e PERCY_SCREEN_HEIGHT="2400" \
  -e PERCY_STATUS_BAR_HEIGHT="50" \
  -e PERCY_NAV_BAR_HEIGHT="48" \
  your-flow.yaml
```

### iOS-specific guidance

The SDK auto-detects the platform via `maestro.platform` — no flag change needed
between Android and iOS flows.

- **`PERCY_NAV_BAR_HEIGHT`**: iOS has no persistent navigation bar. Omit this env
  var on iOS flows (the SDK will not add the field; the CLI defaults to 0).
- **`PERCY_STATUS_BAR_HEIGHT`**: include the notch / Dynamic Island in the value
  if you want the full safe-area excluded from the comparison tile. Typical values:
  - iPhone 14 Pro (Dynamic Island): `59`
  - iPhone 13/14 (notch): `47`
  - iPhone SE (no notch): `20`
- **`PERCY_DEVICE_NAME`**: set to the user-visible device name (e.g. `iPhone 15 Pro`).
- **`PERCY_OS_VERSION`**: iOS major version (e.g. `17`).
- **`PERCY_SCREEN_WIDTH` / `PERCY_SCREEN_HEIGHT`**: device physical pixel
  dimensions. These are pixel values, not points — e.g. iPhone 15 Pro is
  `1179 × 2556` pixels.

Example iOS invocation:

```bash
npx percy app:exec -- maestro test \
  -e PERCY_DEVICE_NAME="iPhone 15 Pro" \
  -e PERCY_OS_VERSION="17" \
  -e PERCY_SCREEN_WIDTH="1179" \
  -e PERCY_SCREEN_HEIGHT="2556" \
  -e PERCY_STATUS_BAR_HEIGHT="59" \
  your-flow.yaml
```

## Regions

Regions let you control which parts of a screenshot Percy compares. Each region specifies an area and an algorithm.

### Algorithms

| Algorithm | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `ignore` | Percy skips this area entirely — any change inside is invisible |
| `standard` | Percy compares normally with standard diff sensitivity |
| `intelliignore` | Percy uses AI-powered comparison that ignores dynamic content like ads and carousels |
| `layout` | Percy checks structural layout but tolerates pixel-level differences |

"Consider region" behavior (focusing comparison on a specific area) is achieved by using `standard` or `intelliignore` on a bounded region.

### Coordinate-based regions

Specify pixel coordinates directly. Coordinates are relative to the screenshot (0,0 is top-left).

```yaml
- runFlow:
    file: percy/flows/percy-screenshot.yaml
    env:
      SCREENSHOT_NAME: HomeScreen
      PERCY_REGIONS: '[{"top":0,"bottom":50,"left":0,"right":1080,"algorithm":"ignore"}]'
```

### Element-based regions

Identify regions by view-hierarchy attributes. Selectors are forwarded to the Percy CLI relay, which resolves them to pixel boxes per platform — Android via ADB view-hierarchy dump, iOS via WebDriverAgent source dump.

| Platform | Supported selector keys (V1) |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Android  | `resource-id`, `text`, `content-desc`, `class` |
| iOS      | `id` (accessibility identifier), `class` |

iOS `text` and `xpath` selectors are deferred to V1.1 — `text` needs predicate-string escaping and `xpath` needs a DoS-complexity heuristic against deep UI trees.

```yaml
# Android
- runFlow:
    file: percy/flows/percy-screenshot.yaml
    env:
      SCREENSHOT_NAME: HomeScreen
      PERCY_REGIONS: '[{"element":{"resource-id":"com.app:id/clock"},"algorithm":"ignore"}]'
```

```yaml
# iOS
- runFlow:
    file: percy/flows/percy-screenshot.yaml
    env:
      SCREENSHOT_NAME: HomeScreen
      PERCY_REGIONS: '[{"element":{"id":"clock-label"},"algorithm":"ignore"}]'
```

> **Status:** element-based regions require a Percy CLI that ships the
> per-platform resolver (ADB resolver for Android, WDA source-dump resolver
> for iOS). Until a resolver-supporting CLI is deployed to your BrowserStack
> Maestro runner, element regions log a warning and are skipped. Coordinate
> regions continue to work during the transition.

### Multi-match behavior

When a selector matches multiple views, the **first match in pre-order traversal** wins (same as `percy-appium-python`). Write more specific selectors to disambiguate when needed.

### Release-build caveat (Android)

Android release builds with `shrinkResources` + R8 resource optimization (AGP 8.12+) may rename the values surfaced as `resource-id`. For selectors that must survive release builds, prefer `content-desc` (accessibility-stable — R8 does not rename) or keep IDs via `keep.xml` / `tools:keep`. iOS selectors are unaffected.

### Advanced: per-region configuration

Each region can include fine-grained diff settings:

```yaml
PERCY_REGIONS: '[{"element":{"resource-id":"com.app:id/header"},"algorithm":"standard","configuration":{"diffSensitivity":3,"imageIgnoreThreshold":0.1}}]'
```

Configuration options: `diffSensitivity` (0-4), `imageIgnoreThreshold` (0-1), `carouselsEnabled`, `bannersEnabled`, `adsEnabled`.

Each region may also include `padding` and `assertion` objects, which are forwarded to the Percy comparison pipeline verbatim.

### Multiple regions

```yaml
PERCY_REGIONS: '[{"element":{"resource-id":"com.app:id/clock"},"algorithm":"ignore"},{"element":{"text":"Submit"},"algorithm":"intelliignore"},{"top":0,"bottom":50,"left":0,"right":1080,"algorithm":"ignore"}]'
```

### Full example with all options

```yaml
- runFlow:
    file: percy/flows/percy-screenshot.yaml
    env:
      SCREENSHOT_NAME: HomeScreen
      PERCY_REGIONS: '[{"element":{"resource-id":"com.app:id/clock"},"algorithm":"ignore"},{"top":0,"bottom":50,"left":0,"right":1080,"algorithm":"ignore"}]'
      PERCY_SYNC: "true"
      PERCY_STATUS_BAR_HEIGHT: "50"
      PERCY_NAV_BAR_HEIGHT: "48"
      PERCY_FULLSCREEN: "false"
      PERCY_TH_TEST_CASE_EXECUTION_ID: "TH-12345"
```

### Graceful degradation

- Invalid JSON in `PERCY_REGIONS` → warning logged, screenshot uploads without regions
- Individual malformed regions → skipped with a per-region warning, valid regions still sent
- Invalid bar heights (non-numeric) → silently omitted; CLI defaults (0) apply
- Element region with no matching view → per-element warning at the CLI; valid regions still upload
- Element resolver unavailable (ADB unreachable on Android, WDA unreachable on iOS) → one warning, all element regions skipped, coordinate regions still upload

## Runtime support

This SDK is supported on **BrowserStack Maestro sessions** (Android and iOS). The Percy CLI's `/percy/maestro-screenshot` relay expects BrowserStack's session-directory file layout (`/tmp/{sessionId}_test_suite/logs/*/screenshots/{name}.png`). Running `maestro test` locally on your laptop is not a supported runtime — the healthcheck will pass but screenshot uploads will 404.

## BrowserStack Integration

You can run Percy Maestro flows on BrowserStack by uploading your Maestro workspace (including the `percy/` directory) as a zip to the BrowserStack Maestro API.

### Enabling Percy in a BrowserStack build

The way you enable Percy in the BrowserStack Maestro build API **differs between iOS and Android**. Android uses `percyOptions`; iOS uses `appPercy`. This asymmetry is intentional — `appPercy` matches BrowserStack's iOS convention (as used by the `percy-xcui-swift` SDK), and Android's `percyOptions` is already in production use.

**Android:**

```bash
curl -u "$BS_USER:$BS_KEY" \
  -X POST "https://api-cloud.browserstack.com/app-automate/maestro/v2/android/build" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "app": "<APP_URL>",
    "testSuite": "<TEST_SUITE_URL>",
    "devices": ["Samsung Galaxy S22-13.0"],
    "project": "my-percy-maestro-project",
    "percyOptions": {
      "enabled": true,
      "percyToken": "<PERCY_TOKEN>"
    }
  }'
```

**iOS:**

```bash
curl -u "$BS_USER:$BS_KEY" \
  -X POST "https://api-cloud.browserstack.com/app-automate/maestro/v2/ios/build" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "app": "<APP_URL>",
    "testSuite": "<TEST_SUITE_URL>",
    "devices": ["iPhone 14-16"],
    "project": "my-percy-maestro-project",
    "appPercy": {
      "PERCY_TOKEN": "<PERCY_TOKEN>",
      "env": {
        "PERCY_BRANCH": "main"
      }
    }
  }'
```

On iOS, the `appPercy.env` sub-object can carry any `PERCY_*` environment variable your Percy build should see — commonly `PERCY_BRANCH`, `PERCY_PROJECT`, `PERCY_COMMIT`. These values are forwarded into the Percy CLI's environment on the BrowserStack host.

**Note on naming:** BrowserStack's public-API parameter is camelCase (`appPercy`). On the BrowserStack host, it is translated to snake_case (`app_percy`) in internal session params. Customers pass `appPercy`; the translation is automatic.

### Percy token hygiene

- **Use a per-project Percy token** when running on BrowserStack App Automate. The token transits BrowserStack infrastructure to reach the Percy CLI on the host. Don't reuse an org-scoped master token for CI builds — use a project-scoped token you can rotate independently.
- **`appPercy.env` safe-character guidance:** values should contain only alphanumeric characters plus `.`, `_`, `-`. Branch names like `main`, `feature/abc_1`, project slugs, and commit SHAs all fit. Avoid spaces, quotes, semicolons, backticks, and other shell metacharacters — they can cause unexpected behavior in the env-forwarding mechanism.

See the [BrowserStack Maestro documentation](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/app-automate/maestro/getting-started) for the general upload/build flow.

## How it works

The Percy Maestro SDK works in two stages:

1. **Initialization** -- The `percy-init` sub-flow runs a healthcheck against the Percy CLI server to verify it is available. If the CLI is not running or not reachable, Percy is silently disabled for the rest of the flow. The CLI version and server address are stored for downstream use.

2. **Screenshot capture** -- Each `percy-screenshot` sub-flow call uses Maestro's built-in `takeScreenshot` command to save a PNG to disk, then runs a JS script that sends screenshot metadata (name, session ID, device tag, regions, tile options) as a JSON POST to the Percy CLI's `/percy/maestro-screenshot` relay endpoint. The Percy CLI finds the screenshot file on disk, base64-encodes it, resolves any element-based regions, and uploads the comparison.

## Features not supported

This section is split into two parts so you can tell *can't build on this runtime* apart from *haven't built yet*.

### Architectural limits (not feasible on this runtime)

These features are blocked by the Maestro / BrowserStack / GraalJS runtime itself. They are not on our roadmap because the underlying environment does not support the mechanism.

| Feature | Reason | Workaround |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| BrowserStack session ↔ Percy build correlation via `browserstack_executor: percyScreenshot begin/end` | Maestro's GraalJS script environment has no Appium driver or `executeScript` surface through which the `browserstack_executor:` string is interpreted. Equivalent correlation would require a BrowserStack Maestro-runner infra change, not an SDK change. | Match `--build-name` between `percy app:exec` and the BrowserStack Maestro build request, or read `BROWSERSTACK_BUILD_ID` from the Maestro flow env and include it in your snapshot names. |
| `fullPage` / `scrollableXpath` / `scrollableId` / `screenLengths` | Maestro controls scrolling via YAML `scroll` commands. | Capture multiple screenshots with `scroll` steps between them. |
| `freezeAnimations` / `percyCSS` / `enableJavascript` | DOM/web-specific. Native mobile screenshots are bitmap captures — no DOM to manipulate. | Use Maestro's own animation controls (e.g., `waitForAnimationToEnd`) before `takeScreenshot`. |
| XPath region selectors on Android | Android view hierarchy does not expose XPath. | Use `resource-id` / `text` / `content-desc` / `class` instead. |
| Auto-detect device metadata on iOS | Maestro's GraalJS sandbox blocks native iOS bindings (`uname`, `UIDevice.current`, `XCUIDevice.shared.orientation`) that SDKs like `percy-xcui-swift` use. | Pass `PERCY_DEVICE_NAME`, `PERCY_OS_VERSION`, `PERCY_SCREEN_WIDTH`, `PERCY_SCREEN_HEIGHT`, `PERCY_ORIENTATION` via flow env vars. |
| Percy on Automate (POA) | POA requires Appium-style driver capabilities and a live session; Maestro has no equivalent execution model. | Use standard Percy snapshot uploads (this SDK) for Maestro-on-BrowserStack. |
| iOS simulator | BrowserStack runs real iOS devices; the SDK is not tested against simulators. | Use BrowserStack real-device iOS sessions. |
| Local `maestro test` runtime | The CLI relay expects BrowserStack's session-directory file layout. | Run on BrowserStack Maestro. See [Runtime support](#runtime-support). |

### Deferred / on roadmap

These are implemented partially or not yet and are expected to land in a future round. Use the interim workaround if you are blocked today.

**Planned for the next round:**

| Feature | Status | Interim workaround |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| `PERCY_IGNORE_ERRORS` / `PERCY_ENABLED` kill-switches | Appium-style config; next-round plan tracked at [`docs/plans/2026-04-23-001-feat-kill-switches-plan.md`](docs/plans/2026-04-23-001-feat-kill-switches-plan.md). Target: next sprint. | Unset `PERCY_TOKEN` in your Maestro flow env to disable Percy without a code change, or remove the `percy-init` / `percy-screenshot` `runFlow` steps from your flow. |
| iOS element-region V1.1 selectors (`text`, `xpath`) | V1 ships `id` + `class` only. `text` requires WDA predicate-string escaping; `xpath` requires a DoS-complexity heuristic. Both deferred to V1.1. | Use `id` or `class` selectors on iOS in the meantime, or fall back to coordinate-based regions. |

**Under evaluation (no committed timeline):**

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| `PERCY_LABELS` rendering in Percy dashboard | The SDK forwards `labels` to the Percy CLI relay correctly, but `percy/core` 1.31.11-beta.0 (and current stable) rejects `labels` on the snapshot-options schema as `"unknown property"` and strips it client-side. Snapshot still uploads; labels are not stored. Fix is a `percy/core` schema update — not an SDK change. |
| `/percy/events` failure telemetry | Not yet forwarded by the SDK. |
| Sync mode (`PERCY_SYNC`) | Implemented in the SDK (accepts the env var and logs the sync result when the relay returns one) but unproven end-to-end on BrowserStack; a prior round saw a 403 on the sync-result query that is believed unrelated backend behavior. |
| `PERCY_TH_TEST_CASE_EXECUTION_ID` dashboard rendering | The SDK forwards this field to the Percy backend (verified end-to-end). However, no Percy dashboard surface currently renders it — this is a `percy-api` serializer gap, tracked separately from this SDK. TestHub integrators can read the value from the Percy CLI debug log. |
